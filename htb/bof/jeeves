This program provides you with a binary and found that its a buffer overflow question

in ghidra 
    local_18
    local_c 
        
        these above statement actually are variables and the number is the distance from top of the stack

    in this program i needed local_c to be 0x1337bab3 so to get to the address just before local_c and then overflow to write the data

    so 

    "a"*72 will overwrite everything upto the return function if it ever reaches there

    so we will stop just before the local _c 

    "a"*(72-12) (c == 12)
    so the payload will be

    "a"*(72-12) + p64(0x1337bab3) putting this payload will return you with the flag
