This involves the knowledge of jwt which is an authentication system
JSON Web Token(JWT)

On opening the page you will have a login page containing username and
password You can enter any value you will get (Not an administrator)

look into the applications part after opening console:
U will see there is a token of the form xxxxxxx.yyyyyyyy.zzzzzzzz

x: this is the header part it mainly contains
	{
	    "arg":"hs256",
	    "typ":"JWT"
	}
y: this is the payload part :
	{
	    "user":"error"
	}
z: this part is header+payload and secret is used to hash with the 
algorithim in the header 

all x y z is then base64url encoded. The ones taken as header + payload is
also base64url encoded and then z is encoded again

you can get x and y by using jwt_tool. then you have to crack using a
wordlist called rockyou as its a weak_secret. 

using that secret you can go to jwt.io to create your own jwt 
then you have to inject that jwt using the cookie editor chrome extension
