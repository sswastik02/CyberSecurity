The problem included entering 2 inputs ..... at first the name and then number to be guessed
the number being generated was truly random and system dependent as /dev/urandom creates random number
based on disk io or network fluctuations or something very unpredictable


but however the urandom was fetched before input of name
so in the name i entered

%p %p %p %p %p %p %p                                7 times

this is a format string exploit 

i noticed that the stack was getting leaked but the first 2 values had 0 change
the next 4 values were changing and then the next one was constant

out of these 4 values the second one which means 4th one in the entire series
was changing to extremes i assumed that to be the random number fetched 

converted that to decimal and then passed that as the guess hence

got the flag
