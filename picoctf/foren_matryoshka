This forensics challenge involved finding files inside image files

first i searched for files using xxd and grep 
i searched for png,jpg and txt ====== > No success

searched for PK (for .zip) found .PK in the file

then used dd to extract 
dd if=2_c.jpg bs=1 skip=187696 of=foo.zip

skip number is obtained from xxd first value
